# Improve Your Workflow with git-extras

The [git-extras project](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) includes a number of
scripts that help simplify common tasks and enhance your workflow. Each script
is an extension to `git` so that they work just like the built-in commands. They
include support for working with branches, remotes, and history, as well as
utilities for viewing information and metrics about your repository.
